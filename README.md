# TableClass

I have created this class because at Ironhack we use a lot Spreadsheets and excels and Google App Script to automate several background operations. This class helps us to access directly to rows and columns using for example their Column Name, the selected row or by a row id. 

## Constructor

```javascript
var myTable = new TableClass("1X4MGBHEH9r-QsvFM0jA2rDDNp_EDS-20W3w19xZCcUI", 
                "Sheet1", 1);  
```

+ spreadSheetID : You can find the the Spreadsheet ID in the Document URL
